I have decided, for now, to continue looking at working through some WebGL tutorials
on transparency, refraction, photon and ray tracing. This is to help me get a better grip on WebGL
and to have a good basis for the prototype I will begin creating next week. Currently I have
three transparent spheres and will update when I have different lighting.

I am also planning to look more into the polarization and to re-read the papers I have and
make sure to concrete my understanding of them. I am also hoping to begin writing my
design specification, though I expect this will happen later in the week, hopefully after
talking to some people from the Physics department, so that I might have a better understanding
of the project at this point.
