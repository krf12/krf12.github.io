Encountered a lot of problems trying to model realistic refraction using the three.js refraction and cube mapping.
I have a feeling this is due to this not being the intended purpose for this kind of refraction and is more intended
to create an illusion of refraction. This means before I can look at how to deal with the model of the cloak and
how the refractive index can be worked out within it, I will need to implement the illumination technique I aim to use.

Most of the research into this I have done suggests that I should use ray tracing, though I am still considering photon
mapping. I am mostly leaning towards ray tracing on the wealth of tutorials and demos available while I am finding more trouble
finding comprehensive demos of photon mapping.

I will update with another post later in the day after meeting with the physics expert and after starting a new version, that will hopefully contain ray tracing, or at least the beginnings of, by the end of today.

Latest version is still found at [Version One](http://krf12.github.io/RenderingInvisibility/pages/version1.html) but this version will
no longer be worked on, though I will use this as a basis for the beginnings of my next version.
