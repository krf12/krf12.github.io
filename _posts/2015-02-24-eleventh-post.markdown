Yesterday I proofread my documentation and then I moved both my Outline Project Specification and my Design Specification (in PDF format) to
a new folder on my github. I have linked to these PDFs on the homepage of my project website. I also completed a basis for the cloak, with
hemispheres instead of spheres so I can change the refraction ratio the front and back half of the spheres. I have also included a cube in
the centre of the shell as the central cloaked object. I will probably use this shell in the next version with the raytracing to achieve a
more realistic refraction model and hopefully be able to create my first model.

I have begun attempting to develop a raytracing engine in a sandbox folder, looking at one of the demos I provided links to in the previous
post - [here](http://iamnop.com/ray/). I am having a couple of problems currently, but I aim to work through those today and will hopefully
have a beginning of an engine and a better understanding after today.
