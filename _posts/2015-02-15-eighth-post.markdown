Apologies for not updating on Friday, illness came back upon me. What I took away from the meeting we had
was confirmation of what we had discussed before and that it might be possible to put polarization in as an
optional endevaour. Also, one of the papers contained a shell diagram that had the refractive indexes for each shell
on it which I had not noticed during my reading of it. This will definitely be helpful in creating the first model. Also there
was a lot of talk on extras, which were interesting, but I feel that I need to concentrate more on the basics of the cloak and it's
basic creation.

As I've had a busy weekend, I have not done as much as I planned. The illness has not completely disappeared either
which is unhelpful. I have got refraction working properly, using cubemaps and three.js refraction mapping. I am still uncertain how to completely
change the refractive index of the materials, but I feel this might be beyond the rudimentary refraction. I have also refactored my code to
be more readable and separated, and having created a function for creating the separate shells of the cloak. I intend to look at the shader language
tonight and see more about the refract function my supervisor mentioned.
