This blog will be used to track my progress throughout this project as well as a way to
articulate what I am currently doing within my project.

My project is titled Rendering Invisibility and the objective of the project is to render
a realistic invisibility cloak based on recent research into transformation optics
and metamaterials. The cloak is intender to not be completely perfect, to
see what effects certain imperfections might cause.

I will be using WebGL and will keeps links to each version I do
within these posts.

Currently I am working on a three.js tutorial that will help me structure my work
and am working on an outline specification as well.

The current version, which is a simple rotating cube is located at:
