This will be how I track my progress throughout this project as well as a way to
articulate what I am doing with my project.

My project is Rendering Invisibility and the objective of the project is to render
a realistic invisibility cloak based on recent research into tranformation optics
and metamaterials. I will be using WebGL and will keeps links to each version I do
within these posts.

Currently I am working on a three.js tutorial that will help me structure my work
and am working on an outline specification as well.

The current version, which is a simple rotating cube is located at:
