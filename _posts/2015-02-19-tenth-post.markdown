I have found a couple of good ray tracing demos that seem to include at least reflection in the rendering and the code is
relatively well documented. These can be found [here](http://people.mozilla.org/~sicking/webgl/ray.html) and [here](http://iamnop.com/ray/). Hopefully these will help me create a first ray tracer
that won't break my graphics driver :/ I am considering that perhaps my laptop is unsuited for this project, but I have been doing
a lot more work at home than elsewhere so it is a conundrum.

I have completed the first version of my design specification will look to proofreading and completing it tonight. I am thinking I may add them to OneDrive and then add links on my blog so that my documentation is also available for progress tracking. If I intend to do this, I will include the links to my outline specification in my next blog post. For now, my outline project specification and design specification are in my github repository.
