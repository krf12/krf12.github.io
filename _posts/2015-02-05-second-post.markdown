Currently I have been looking more at Transformation optics, specifically a paper
called 'Transformation Optics and the Geometery of Light'. It explains the theory
behind Transformation Optics and how it relates to optics as we know it. The theories
surrounding Transformation Optics are the basis of research into invisibility cloaking
and negative refraction.

I have also watched a lecture by Professor John Pendry about metamaterials and
the science of invisibility. This explains a lot more about the idea of
transformation optics and prototypes created using metamaterials that use these
ideas. There is currently a prototype of a 'carpet cloak' that can hide bumps in
flat surfaces from visible light. There is also a 2D electromagnetic invisibility
cloak that hides objects from electromagnetic waves while limiting disruption to
the electromagnetic field.

These are all a good basis for understanding the theory behind what I am attempting
to do with my project. After talking with my supervisor, I am going to look more
into polarization and how that might affect the invisibility cloak. I am also going
to start prototyping the illumination that I'm planning to use as well as the cloak.
